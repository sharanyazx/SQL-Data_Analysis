-- Window Functions

-- windows functions are powerful and are somewhat like a group by - except they don't roll everything up into 1 row when grouping. 
-- windows functions allow us to look at a partition or a group, but they each keep their own unique rows in the output

SELECT * 
FROM employee_demographics;

--  group by
SELECT gender, ROUND(AVG(salary),1)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
GROUP BY gender
;

-- similar with a window function

SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
AVG(salary) OVER()
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
;



--  partition is kind of like the group by except it doesn't roll up - it just partitions or breaks based on a column when doing the calculation

SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
AVG(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY gender)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
;


-- the salaries for genders we could do that by using sum, but also we could use order by to get a rolling total

SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
SUM(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY employee_id)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
;


--  row_number rank and dense rank now


SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY gender)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
;

-- ordering by salary so we can see the order of highest paid employees by gender
SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY salary desc)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id

-- let's compare this to rank
SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,

Rank() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY salary desc) rank_1 
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
